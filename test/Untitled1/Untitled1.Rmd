# Get the data

First of all, we need to load all the required packages.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)    # You need this library to run this template.
library(ndrmd)      # Install with devtools: install_github("yyyoment/ndrmd", force=TRUE)
```

Then I explain what is my input data and I load it. Here is how it looks like:
```{r}
# Show it:
mtcars %>% head(5)
```

This file has `r nrow(mtcars)` lines and `r ncol(mtcars)` columns. It is ready to be analysed.

```{r}
# Here is the summary of the mtcar dataset:
summary(mtcars)
```

<div class="color">
If you want to write some analysis or conclusion, you can put it here.
